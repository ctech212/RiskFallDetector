# Risk Fall Detector


  Risk Falls Detector in Hospitality is an application used to facilitate the nurse for knowing the risk of falling and monitoring the patient's condition. This application will identify patients who are at risk of falling under the "Fall Risk Assessment", conducting patient re-assessment (monitoring), and setting standards for preventing and managing risks falling comprehensively. This application will be linked with a database that will facilitate the hospital in collecting patient annual data, but in this application is focused on the indicator of the risk of falling patients. Nurses will easily know the risk of falling a patient since they come to the hospital.
  
  This application will provide recommendations to nurses and patients about what to do and what not to do during hospitalization. There are several indicators that should be included by the nurse as patient data. The data can be updated periodically to adjust the patient's condition. When the nurse who takes care of the patient changes, it will be replaced by another nurse whose system that all nurses will have accounts that can alternate handle a patient who has a medical number. The nurse can input medical number when going to input data or update the patient's condition data.
